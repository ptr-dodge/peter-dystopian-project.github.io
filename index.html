                        <li>Dust storms are a type of storm that is caused by the dust in the atmosphere.</li>
                        <li>
                            the dust storms force people to stay inside and threaten human survival.

                            they cause damage to living spaces and infrastructure, setting the scene.

                    <ul>
                        <li>their planet is nearly inhabitible</li>
                        <li>sets a lurking mood of inevitability</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>In the Movie, the schools are teaching that the moon landing was fake and are also teaching the
                        kids how to go into agriculture instead of being an astronaut, programmer, etc.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The world is in peril: they need more farmers not technology</li>
                        <li>the government is supposedly corrupt</li>
                        <li>they've fallen away from what was once accepted as the truth based on facts<br><small>this
                                shows how much things can fall into dissent due to multiple generations questioning
                                facts (if that makes sense)</small></li>

                <h2>what we claim</h2>
                <p>I think the authors are trying to say that in the state that mankind is in right now is headed in a bad direction.</p>
                <p>There may be things we can do about it, but it won't be easy.</p>
            </article>

                <h2>present</h2>
                <p>There are similar problems in our world, there is global warming and worldwide pandemics.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>future</h2>
                <p>If living continues in this direction, it may cause substantial changes that endanger human life. We might benefit from a Technological revolution, already it may be impossible.</p>

                <h2>real world connections</h2>
                <p>I think the authors were trying to point out world problems</p>
                <p>The authors possibly put this in because it was a realistic dystopia.</p>
                <p>I the authors may have just needed a problem to add to the story</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6587682/">This article</a> says there is “…much to be done…”. 
                    We can find alternative power sources to limit and reduce emissions causing global warming.</p>
